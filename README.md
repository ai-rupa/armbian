## Purpose of This Repository

The **Armbian Linux Build Framework** creates customizable OS images based on **Debian** or **Ubuntu** for **single-board computers (SBCs)** and embedded devices.

It builds a complete Linux system including kernel, bootloader, and root filesystem, giving you control over versions, configuration, firmware, device trees, and system optimizations.

The framework supports **native**, **cross**, and **containerized** builds for multiple architectures (`x86_64`, `aarch64`, `armhf`, `riscv64`) and is suitable for development, testing, production, or automation.

> **Looking for prebuilt images?** Use [Armbian Imager](https://github.com/armbian/imager/releases) — the easiest way to download and flash Armbian to your SD card or USB drive. Available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/armbian/build
cd build
